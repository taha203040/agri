Excellent project. Here is a reorganized and classified version of the soil sampling guide data, structured for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The information is broken into logical categories with clear headings and key details extracted for easy querying.

### **Document 1: General Principles & Core Concepts**

*   **Purpose of Soil Analysis:** The foundational step in a sound fertility program. A tool to guide toward goals of high yields, top quality, and environmental stewardship.
*   **Core Principle:** Accurate analysis depends entirely on **properly taken samples**. Sampling technique is the greatest source of error. Lab analysis cannot correct for an unrepresentative sample.
*   **Use of Reports:** Soil reports should be used **in conjunction with other information** to make fertilizer and lime recommendations.
*   **Testing Frequency (Gardening Context):**
    *   For most gardeners: Every **3 years**.
    *   More frequent testing is appropriate for intensive production (vegetable gardens, small fruits, tree fruits).
    *   Test when unusual, persistent problems occur that aren't due to weather or pests.

### **Document 2: Pre-Sampling Planning & Area Selection**

*   **Timing:**
    *   Can be done any time of year.
    *   **Best Practice:** Sample the same field at about the **same time each year** for consistency.
    *   **Wait:** Minimum **30 days** after applications of fertilizer, lime, or sulfur.
    *   **Gardening Context:** Late summer or fall before soil temps drop below 50°F is ideal, allowing time for amendments to integrate.
*   **Defining the Sample Area:**
    *   The sample must be **representative** of the area to be treated.
    *   **Division Methods:** Divide large fields into "like" areas based on:
        *   Soil color.
        *   Aerial photographs (e.g., County ASCS).
        *   Differences in **slope, drainage, past treatment, or soil type**.
    *   **Sample Area Size:** Should be large enough to justify special lime/fertilizer treatments. University of Illinois recommends a single sample represent **no more than 5 acres**.
*   **Locations to AVOID Sampling:**
    *   Dead/back furrows, fence rows, old roadbeds, near limestone gravel roads.
    *   Terrace channels, wind/snow fence lines, turn-rows.
    *   Spill areas, fertilizer bands (including Anhydrous N).
    *   Any unusual or abnormal spots.

### **Document 3: Sampling Procedure: Tools & Technique**

*   **Equipment:**
    *   **Sampling Tools:** Use **chrome-plated or stainless steel** tubes/augers. A clean spade/shovel is acceptable. **Avoid** galvanized, bronze, or brass tools.
    *   **Collection Container:** Use a **clean plastic bucket**. **Avoid** galvanized or rubber buckets (cause contamination).
*   **Sampling Strategy:**
    *   **Number of Cores:** A minimum of **10 cores per sample**, sometimes 15 or more, depending on soil variability and area size. Fewer cores increase year-to-year variability.
    *   **Gardening Context:** For uniform areas, collect **3-5 samples per 2000 sq ft**, mix into one composite sample. For lawns: one composite sample per 5000 sq ft (e.g., front/back separately).
    *   **Technique:** Take random cores across the defined sample area. Remove surface debris prior to sampling.
*   **Depth Consistency:** Critical because soils can be stratified. **Depth must remain consistent** within a sample set to avoid errors.
    *   **Testing for Stratification:** Sample separately at intervals (0-2", 2-4", 4-6", 6-8") using the recommended number of cores. Greater differences in analysis between depths indicate higher stratification.

### **Document 4: Sample Handling, Submission & Forms**

*   **Mixing & Packaging:**
    1.  Thoroughly mix all core samples in a plastic bucket.
    2.  Take a **well-mixed composite sample (½ to 1 pint / ~2 cups)** from the mixture.
    3.  Place into lab's bag (fill to line) or a **new plastic sandwich bag (double-bagged)**.
*   **Special Handling for Nitrogen Tests:** Samples for Nitrogen analysis should be **immediately air-dried, shipped early in the week, or shipped frozen**.
*   **Labeling:**
    *   On the bag: Write **Sample ID**, sub-sample ID (if applicable), and **customer name**.
    *   Air-dry sample (gardening context) before bagging; do not apply heat.
*   **Information Form:**
    *   Record the **same Sample IDs and customer name/address** as on the bag.
    *   Include your business name/address if applicable.
    *   **Gardening Context:** Note the crop to be grown, previous fertilizer practices, and a brief description or map of the sampled area.
*   **Shipping:**
    *   Use provided shipping containers or a strong envelope/box.
    *   Include the completed information form.

### **Document 5: Special Sampling Scenarios & Depths (Reference Table)**

*   **Key Reference:** *Table 1: Depth to Sample*
*   **Organized by Land Use / Test Type:**

| Type of Sample | Sample Depth | Key Notes / Instructions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conventional Tillage** | 7" | Depth must remain constant. |
| **Strip/Band Fertilization (known)** | 7" | See diagram for instructions. |
| **Strip/Band Fertilization (unknown)** | 7" | Take **20+ random samples 90° to band rows**. |
| **Reduced Tillage or No-Till** | 2" **and** 7" | 2" sample is for surface pH determination. |
| **Orchards & Trees** | 7" | Sample inside the **"drip line"** of the tree. |
| **Lawn / Turf** | 4" | **Remove the sod piece** from each core. |
| **Pasture** | 4" | **Remove the sod piece** from each core. |
| **Special Problem Solving** | 7" **and** 36" | Take both from the **"same hole"**. |
| **Pre-Sidedress Nitrogren Test (PSNT)** | 12" | When corn is 10"-12" tall. |
| **Soil Nitrogen Tests** | 12" to 36" | Drier climates require deeper samples. |
| **Soybean Cyst Nematode** | 7" | Sample near planted row, in fringe of damaged areas. |
| **General Garden Beds** (Annuals/Perennials) | 6" to 8" | Gardening context. |
| **Vegetable Beds** | 6" to 10" | Gardening context. |

### **Document 6: Testing Rationale & University Extension Guidance**

*   **What a Basic Soil Test Provides:**
    1.  Soil pH (acidity/alkalinity).
    2.  Phosphorous (P) content.
    3.  Potassium (K) content.
    4.  Percentage of Organic Matter.
*   **Common Additional Elements:** Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg). Their levels indicate soil's nutrient storage reserve and lime history. **Over-liming is a common mistake.**
*   **Complete Analysis:** May be needed for recurring problems with no other explanation. Analyzes all major and minor elements.
*   **Sampling for Trees/Shrubs:** Sample in the zone of **actively feeding roots**, typically at the **drip line** of the outermost branches.
*   **Service Provider Example:** Soil testing available through **University of Missouri Extension** (with associated fees).
